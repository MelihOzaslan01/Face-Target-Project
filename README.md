# Face Target Project with Arduino Uno



## About the Project
This project aims to recognize and track a targeted person using facial recognition technology. The project can work on live video streams or recorded videos. It can detect and track the targeted person while recognizing them using a facial recognition algorithm. It uses Arduino Uno to integrate with servo motors to automatically track the detected face and perform movements.

## Features
- Ability to recognize and track a targeted person
- Use of facial recognition algorithm
- Analyze facial data from live video streams
- Track and follow the face from a camera or video source
- Track the detected face using servo motors to perform target tracking


## Installation and Usage


### Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV Library
3. Arduino Uno
4. Servo Motor
5. Arduino Uno Sensor Shield
6. External Camera (optional, can also work with the built-in camera on a laptop)
7. 3D Printing (optional, a structure can be used to fix the servo motors, simple wood or plastic can be used)
8. STL files for 3D Printing are available (some parts may need to be adjusted according to the camera type, so you can get support from tools like TinkerCAD) Note: Some parts of this project have been modified for printing
9. "Rigid Zero" brand 3D Printer was used for 3D printing

------------



### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

 bash
   `git clone https://github.com/MelihOzaslan01/face-target-project.git`

- Save to grepper

2	.  Go to the project folder:

bashCopy code

`cd face-target-project`

3 .	Install the required dependencies:

bashCopy code

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

------------



## Usage

1. Start the project by running the following command in the project folder:

bashCopy code

`python main.py`

2	. When the project is running, a live video stream or a recorded video will open. Frame the targeted person's face correctly and start the tracking process. Add any additional information that you need to consider when using or testing the project here.

##Contributing

1. To contribute to this project, create a branch:
